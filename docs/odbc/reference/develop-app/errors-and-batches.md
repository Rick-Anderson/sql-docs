# Errors and Batches
When an error occurs while executing a batch of SQL statements, one of the following four outcomes are possible. (Each possible outcome is data source-specific and might even depend on the statements included in the batch.)  
  
-   No statements in the batch are executed.  
  
-   No statements in the batch are executed and the transaction is rolled back.  
  
-   All of the statements before the error statement are executed.  
  
-   All of the statements except the error statement are executed.  
  
 In the first two cases, **SQLExecute** and **SQLExecDirect** return SQL_ERROR. In the latter two cases, they may return SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO or SQL_SUCCESS, depending on the implementation. In all cases, further error information can be retrieved with **SQLGetDiagField**, **SQLGetDiagRec**, or **SQLError**. However, the nature and depth of this information is data source-specific. Furthermore, this information is unlikely to exactly identify the statement in error.
